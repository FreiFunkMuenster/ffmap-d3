[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ffnord/ffmap-d3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ffnord/ffmap-d3)

This repository shows the graph of all nodes in the freifunk network.
if you clone this repository, you also need to download some sample data into nodes.json, for example the nodes of Freifunk LÃ¼beck:

https://luebeck.freifunk.net/map/nodes.json


Development
===========

To build the project, you need to have nodejs and grunt-cli installed.
Install the nodejs packages for your operating system (and npm, if those packages do not already contain it).
Then install the grunt-cli node package globally, by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
After that run `npm install` in the root directory of the project.

You are now ready to build the project by running `grunt`. To start a development server on localhost,
you can use `grunt dev`. This task will build the project, start a [development server](http://localhost:8000/),
and watch the source files for changes.
